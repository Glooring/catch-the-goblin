# Catch The Goblin Game ðŸŽ®

**Catch The Goblin** lets players capture elusive goblins within a retro-inspired arena. Originally inspired by a game I stumbled across on [gameee.vercel.app](https://gameee.vercel.app), this project enhances and completes the foundation left by the original. The goal was to improve functionality, add mobile support, and provide a more engaging gameplay experience.
